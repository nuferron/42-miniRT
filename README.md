# 42-miniRT
The aim of this project is to provide an educational and accessible introduction to the fundamentals of ray tracing. By implementing a simplified version of a ray tracing engine, MiniRT allows users to grasp core concepts such as light-ray interactions, geometric optics, and basic shading techniques. This project focuses on rendering simple geometric shapes, applying basic lighting models, and understanding the mathematical principles behind realistic image generation. MiniRT serves as a stepping stone for those interested in exploring the more complex and advanced aspects of computer graphics and rendering.
